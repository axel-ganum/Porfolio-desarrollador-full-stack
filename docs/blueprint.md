## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Indigo (#6366f1), maintaining the accent color from the original design to highlight interactive elements.
- Background color: Dark navy blue (#0a192f) with partial transparency to maintain the current design. HSL values of the background are very similar to that of the indigo primary, but very desaturated and dark.
- Accent color: Light blue (#ADD8E6). This color sits just to the 'left' of the indigo primary color, and has a saturation between the primary and background. This hue will make a good contrast with the background.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, is the best match because it projects a modern, machined look suitable for the code snippets.
- Maintain a clean, modern layout with clear sections for each part of the portfolio.
- Subtle fade-in animations on page load and hover effects to enhance user engagement.
- Use modern, minimalist icons to represent different skills and strengths.
